            question: "Can I take both my Essential One and my Personalised Plus supplements?",
            answer: "No need! You only need to take one or the other. Your Essential One is designed to cover just the essentials and will only include vitamins and minerals (1 x supplement per day). Your Personalised Plus will cover the essentials and provide additional nutritional support, such as herbal extracts, omega 3 and/or adaptogens to help you reach your health goals (4 x supplements per day in handy daily strips)."

        {
            question: "Can I integrate my DNA or Blood Test results to further personalise my supplements?",
            answer: "Yes! It's free to integrate your results from any of the Vitl test kits, including the Vitamin DNA Test, Nutrition DNA Test and Vitamin & Cholesterol Blood test. You can integrate these results whenever you like and they will then be used alongside your consultation results to tailor your supplement formulations."

        {
            question: "What happens if my diet, lifestyle or health goals change?",
            answer: "Easy peasy! All you need to do is retake your consultation and we will update your tailor-made formulas. Your personalised supplements will be delivered monthly so the new formulas will be included in your next delivered pack. We recommend retaking your consultation at least every 3 months to ensure your personalised supplements fully cater to your needs."
